# mcav_phenogeno
Code used for my honors thesis analyzing phenotypic variation and differential gene expression in m. cavernosa (great star coral)

SkeletalWeightAnalysis is code for the analysis of the change in bouyant weight (as an indicator of skeletal growth), starting with a csv file.

Deseq... contains my code for differential gene expression analysis from data wrangling through visualization (venn diagram, heatmap, PCoA
analysis). Also at the end there is formating for the creation of files for gene ontology (GO) analysis starting with a counts file.
